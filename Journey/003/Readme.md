# New post title here

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è So today l will be creating an EC2 instance then launch it using the AWS Console. EC2 is one of the most popular offering from AWS and l want yo know more about it.

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è General knowledge of a computer and the internet is enough to understand this topic.

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è (Show-Me) Create an graphic or diagram that illustrate the use-case of how this knowledge could be applied to real-world project
- ‚úçÔ∏è (Show-Me) Explain in one or two sentences the use case

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è Document your trial and errors. Share what you tried to learn and understand about the cloud topic or while completing micro-project.
- üñºÔ∏è Show as many screenshot as possible so others can experience in your cloud research.

## Short Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understanding how the cloud works. 

### Step 1 ‚Äî Creating an Amazon Machine Image(AMI)

I navigated to the the AWS console then typed EC2 into the services section.The next step was to click on Launch instances. After that l had to choose an AMI as shown below.
An AMI is the operating system that will be launced on the server.

### Step 2 ‚Äî Choosing the Instance type

So when we choose an AMI we also have to choose the type of machine. When choosing the type of machine we will be specyfing how powerful we want our machine to be. The options are shown on the image below.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Configuring Instance Details
This step has so many options and as shown by the image below we can configure different details. A noteable element that l want to point out is that this where we
can put the user data. This is a question that l have seen a lot in my Practice tests for SAA-C02.
