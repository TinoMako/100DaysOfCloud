## Introduction

✍️ I will be continuing from where l left off yesterday. We created our EC2 instance and now we have to figure out how to connect to it. Different operating systems have different ways of accessing instances. Windows 10 users, Linux users and Mac users can use SSH to connect but users of the previous windows before 10 will have to use Putty. Interestingly Windows 10 users can use both Putty and SSH. In this tutorial l will be using Putty even though l am using windows 10, l could have used SSH but l just felt like using Putty. 

## Prerequisite

✍️ Anyone can follow along.

## Try yourself

✍️ SSH is a cool way of allowing a user access to fully control a machine remotely using the command line.

### Step 1 — Downloading Putty

The first thing we have to do is to download Putty. We just type 'Putty' on google and click on the first search result. After downloading we will install Putty which is just straightforward with not much hustle.
